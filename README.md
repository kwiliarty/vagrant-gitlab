# Vagrant Box

The idea is that you can create an installation of gitlab with some of the CI tools installed so that you can mess around with different runners or build CI scripts locally.

Improvements welcome!

## Installation

### Requirements

  * Besides vagrant you'll also want to have the vagrant-hostsupdater plugin. 
  * This box uses 6GB of memory. That's more than the usual Vagrant machine.

### Vagrant UP

Just clone and vagrant up. :smile:

NOTE: The initial admin user is: root
The initial password is: 5iveL!fe

You'll be prompted to update the password on first log in.
